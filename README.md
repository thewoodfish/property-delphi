Property Delphi is a blockchain solution built with <a target="_blank" href="https://use.ink">ink!</a>, which empowers you to create an indisputable, irrefutable proof of ownership of your various properties. e.g a plot of land.
With Property Delphi, nobody can take what is yours and leave you with nothing.

# Property Delphi Smart Contract
This repo contains the code for the delphi smart contract running on a typical substrate contracts node. The property oracle contract is very important because it records critical information about users of the networks, the properties being secured or claimed, the claims and right to claim of the properties and so on, serving as a source of truth and decisions. We would examine the contract properly. The property delphi contract is completely built with <a target="_blank" href="https://use.ink">ink!</a> which is the best language for writing smart contracts.

## Notable Property Delphi Operations

## Going forward
There a few improvements being considered for property delphi going forward.
- Pinning the necessary files e.i credentials, DID documents etc on storage layers especially the CRUST network.
- Implementing a multisignature attestation mechanism.
- etc.
