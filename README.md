Property Delphi is a blockchain solution built with <a target="_blank" href="https://use.ink">ink!</a>, which empowers you to create an indisputable, irrefutable proof of ownership of your various properties. e.g a plot of land.
With Property Delphi, nobody can take what is yours and leave you with nothing.

## How does Property Delphi Work?

- A certain authority creates a property document schema and lists the fields that must be filled in the document.
- Users can then fill the document and submit it. This filled document is accessible to the user and authority.
- Signatures: After proper investigation by the authority, the authority signs the document. The property document and its information (including the rightful current owner) is only considered true and valid when the authority signs it.
- The signatures are recorded on the blockchain and timestamped, thereby cementing an individuals claim to the property, from now to eternity. 
- Properties can be transferred from one individual to the other, e.g from father to son in a secure, transparent and immutable fashion.
- The documents are stored on IPFS, with the CIDs recorded onchain, hence making them secure and immutable.
- All these interactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency and security.

## Notable Property Delphi Operations
- `Search for property`

## How to run or test Property Delphi
- Install `npm` and `nodeJS` on your computer with `v18+`.
- Clone this(Property Delphi) repo.
- Set up a local contracts node. Directions are given here -> https://github.com/thewoodfish/property-delphi-contract#running-a-local-node
- Run `npm install`.
- After installation of all the necessary packages, run `npm start`.
- Start interacting with Property Delphi and making state changes onchain!

### The Delphi Contract
The Property Delphi contract code can can be found here at -> https://github.com/thewoodfish/property-delphi-contract

## Going forward
There a few improvements being considered for property delphi going forward.
- Pinning the necessary files e.i credentials, DID documents etc on storage layers especially the CRUST network.
- Implementing a multisignature attestation mechanism.
- etc.

### Final
So all in all, even though your physical documents can be duplicated or falsified by scammers, once you fill your document using property delphi and get the right authority to sign it, üòÅ YOU MY FRIEND, ARE VERY SAFE, FOREVER! The great Delphi will always speak in your favour!

Thank you for your time, God bless you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
